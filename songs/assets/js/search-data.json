Saw the wire and fences Flowers that mark graves Rooms of limbs Rooms of cases Flags of nations Pictures of many faces. In the barracks the bunks Were disinfected The straw was clean And walls painted . A lorry was selling Coca Cola On the tracks where the trains Stopped Where the number was millions Yet each had a name. I walked out under “Arbeit Macht Frei” I wanted to see the pond where ashes were scattered . It was getting late . We had still far to travel I didn't look back . Walked out like good SS man After a long hard day's work. ",

The units have been on the move since Sunday The churches were closed on that day. The mothers have taken in their children And the priests hidden their robes away. Meanwhile… Up in the villas they're dancing Holding fashion shows and drinking champagne. Stories in the street of fighting, They pulled out more bodies today. We're dumping food in the oceans, Burying it in holes in the ground, Sending out pills to the starving To keep their population down. The pacifists are blowing up the bomb factories The warmongers are threatening to quit. The suicide squad is restless They're not taking out any life memberships. We're killing people cause they re too old, Killing then cause they're too young, Sending out signals to Saturn To find a solution for everyone . The soldiers can't control the traffic, People selling anything they can find, Trying to get out to the country, Don't they know there's only one place they can hide. I tried to find me a doctor, But she won't talk till she's paid. Told me the post boxes have been sealed up And anyway she's leaving today. All the books are being rewritten To show that nothing has changed. That good and bad never mattered That no one is guilty of blame. I wanted to speak with my mother, But heard that the phones had been tapped And there is no trace of Bobby. None of his neighbours will talk. No one is paying much attention The troops have been deployed in vain. I tried the radio but there's no one talking They just play the same tune all day. There are so many rumours about here it's not easy to tell what is true Nobody's reading the news papers, No point in watching the news. In Disneyland the cream has turned sour, Trish. Everyone just wants to have their own fun. The revolution has been a disaster It hasn't turned out the way it was planned. Maybe I should have been a Nobel Prize winner, I could have had children by now. But maybe I should count myself lucky I have nobody who'll sell me out. Well I knew something was happening Though I never thought things were that strange, Until someone mentioned the test tubes They found near the site of mass graves . I haven't had any sleep since Sunday Don't know when the sirens will cease, If it's only a drill as they say Trish. Why can't I find me a priest. Trish, I was lucky to get here On my way up I saw the crews. They won't get here until midnight Cause all the road signs have been removed . Please open the door, Trisha You know they say each must look after his own. But I could not leave a friend alone in this place Not when there's a chance of the coming of dawn. ",

A scream broke the night and was replaced By silence. My mother then rushed to see What evil had come to our family I heard her fall and I heard her scream Then silence . In my bed I tried to hear But no noise from anywhere came near The light from outside shone so bright As if a star had split the night. I rose and made my way to see The sight that awaited me. On the stairs my mother lay My father beside her in a similar way Both faces starred into the night With eyes that burned and souls that cried. The trees swayed The wind blew As if afraid The moon kept watch on the closing day .
